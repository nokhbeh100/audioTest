Audio signal processing test:
Write a code in python that can distinguish between the following audios:

1. special signal
2. silence
3. person talking

Each audio should be segmented into these three possible sections. If the special signal is a DTMF signal, the phone number should be extracted.
The output should look like the following example:

mode, start, end, phone number/type of signal
special, 0, 1.2,
talking, 1.2, 3.1,
silence, 3.1, 4.2,
special, 4.2, 5, 3231
